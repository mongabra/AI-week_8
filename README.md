### Task 1: AI Agent Implementation Strategy

AutoParts Inc. can deploy a coordinated ecosystem of AI Agents to address quality issues, machine downtime, and labor inefficiencies. Below are three proposed agents and their roles:

1. Quality Inspection Agent (Computer Vision Agent)

Performs automated visual inspection of precision parts using a camera system.

Detects defects in real-time and classifies them.

Sends alerts to supervisors and logs defects for further analysis.

Expected Impact: Reduce 15% defect rate to below 5%.

2. Predictive Maintenance Agent

Monitors IoT sensor data (vibration, temperature, noise).

Predicts machine failures using ML forecasting models.

Automatically schedules preventive maintenance tasks.

Expected Impact: Reduce unplanned downtime by 40–60%.

3. Workforce Optimization Agent

Analyzes worker availability, skills, and workload.

Generates optimized shift schedules.

Reduces overtime and improves efficiency.

Expected Impact: 20–30% reduction in labor costs.

### Task 2: ROI and Implementation Timeline
Return on Investment (Estimated)
Area	Current Loss	Improvement	Annual Savings
Product Defects	$1.2M/yr loss	Reduce to 5%	$800,000 saved
Machine Downtime	10 hrs/month	Reduce by 60%	$300,000 saved
Overtime Labor	$500k/yr	Reduce by 30%	$150,000 saved
Inventory Delays	$200k/yr	Cut by 40%	$80,000 saved

Total Estimated Annual ROI: ~$1.33M
Year-1 Implementation Cost: ~$185k
Payback Period: ~2–4 months

Timeline (3 Months Total)
Phase	Duration	Activities
Data Collection	2 weeks	Install sensors, gather images
Model Development	3–4 weeks	Train CV + maintenance models
n8n Workflow Setup	1–2 weeks	Build automation triggers
Pilot Deployment	2 weeks	Test on one production line
Full Rollout	1 month	Extend to entire factory
### Task 3: Risks and Mitigation Strategies
Technical Risks

Low model accuracy: Improve dataset diversity and continuous retraining.

Sensor failures: Use redundant sensors and scheduled calibration.

Integration challenges: Start with a pilot before scaling.

Organizational Risks

Worker resistance: Provide training and involve staff in the process.

Skill gaps: Offer upskilling programs for digital workflows.

Ethical Risks

Job displacement concerns: Ensure AI augments rather than replaces workers.

Scheduling bias: Audit optimization logic regularly.

Data privacy: Limit access to personal performance data.
